# CNN-Cancer
Predicting cancer diagnosis using convolutional neural network. I did not upload the large dataset to this repo. If you would like to run this notebook locally, please download the data from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview) and add the data files to a folder called "data"
